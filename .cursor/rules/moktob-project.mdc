# Feature Request Rule (Token Optimized)

When user requests a new feature, respond with this structure BEFORE coding:

🎯 [Feature Name]
Purpose: [One sentence description]

🔍 Implementation Plan
Files to modify: [List key files]

New components: [If any]

Database changes: [If needed]

🧪 Test Plan
New test files: [List any new test files to be created, e.g., test_feature.py]

Modified test files: [List existing test files that need updates]

Key test cases:

Unit Tests: Verify the core logic of new functions in isolation.

Integration Tests: Ensure the new feature interacts correctly with other modules (e.g., API endpoint calls the right database function).

UI Tests (if applicable): Check that new UI components render correctly and user interactions work as expected.

⚠️ Considerations
Challenges: [Key risks/issues]

Impact: [On existing functionality]
